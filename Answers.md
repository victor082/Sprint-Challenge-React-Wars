1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
To think in React for me is to break up things into its core components. That means UI and the Javascript portion. You build the overall app while filling it in with it's functionality. You also have to be weary of where the state is and what it is being called.

Functional components is where the props are passed and it returns the UI. Whereas the Class component is where the state sort of lives. It is where the data is.

The state is the data essentially. They get managed within a component. 

1.  Describe props.
Props are what is being passed down by the states. It sort of trinkles the data from the state to the other components.
